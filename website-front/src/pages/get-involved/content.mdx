Thank you for your interest in helping out! We really appreciate it!

This is a new project and we are still building all the basic
mechanisms we need to make it work. So there are a few ways you can help out now, and there are some plans that you can plug into later on.

# Tell us about yourself

This is especially helpful because we need to know what kinds of people are willing to stand up for this cause.

We are still in an information-gathering phase and would like to know about you and your opinions. Please fill in the form below. And if you are interested in getting involved and being kept up to date then please make sure you fill in your contact details at the end.

# Help spread the word

This is the most impactful thing you can do for us right now. The more people who are involved here the better off we'll all be.

## Facebook

If you are active on Facebook then please join our group and share it with your friends.

<CallToAction
  title=""
  buttonLink={FACEBOOK_GROUP}
  buttonText="Join our Facebook group"
  icon={<FacebookIcon />}
  newTab
/>

## Twitter

If you are active on Twitter then you can follow us. Please like and retweet our content to spread the word.

<CallToAction
  title=""
  buttonLink={`https://twitter.com/${TWITTER_HANDLE}`}
  buttonText="Follow us on Twitter"
  icon={<TwitterIcon />}
  newTab
/>

## Just talk

Talk to the people around you - your friends, neighbors, colleagues - see how they feel about our country. Listen to them. Then share this with them. The simple act of communicating like a human can be very powerful.

# Collect hard-hitting stories

We are looking for personal stories about how the electricity crisis has impacted people in serious ways. We hope to use these stories to inspire people to take action.

Here are some examples of things we want to hear about:

- People losing their jobs or income, and the consequences of that
- Businesses needing to close or fire people
- People's health being badly effected
- Education being disrupted
- Anything else that you think will move people

If you have a story like that then please share it with us!

<CallToAction
  title=""
  buttonLink="https://forms.gle/csFshJXeaHunYFyC9"
  buttonText="Tell us your story"
  newTab
/>

And of course if you know anyone with a story, please ask them to share.

# If you are a programmer, write some code

If you have the skills to help out on some coding then we would love to have you. All of our code is open source and can be found on Github.

# Stand up to corruption in your own life

It can be hard to take a personal stand against corruption. Many people can't get by at all without paying bribes. But there are ways to fight back.

1. [Know your rights](https://www.corruptionwatch.org.za/know-your-rights-when-dealing-with-police/)
2. [Report corruption when you see it](https://www.corruptionwatch.org.za/take-action/report-corruption/how-to-report-corruption-to-us/)
3. [Register to vote](https://www.elections.org.za/pw/voter/voter-registration-campaign). And then when it comes time to vote, don't look for the perfect political party - it doesn't exist. Vote against corruption.
