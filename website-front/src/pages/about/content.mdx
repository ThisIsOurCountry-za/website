# We are ...

We are a group of South Africans who have been watching the decline of our country for years. We believe that South Africa will fall unless there is a major change. We want to stay in South Africa - this is our home.

We have been watching our friends, loved ones, colleagues and acquaintances leave the country. We have stayed and our lives have gotten harder and harder over time. We've seen so many new faces begging on the street. We are afraid of what might happen to us if we stay.

Many of us have been tempted to leave - we've watched our currency lose its value over time. We know that the longer we wait the harder it will be to leave. We don't want to leave but we are afraid for ourselves, our children, and for those who are not in a position to get out. Our country feels like a sinking ship.

We believe that if there are enough of us standing together and making the right demands in the right way we can turn things around.

# We're different

There are organizations in South Africa that are already focused on fighting corruption and making our country a better place. We are big fans of their work. But we have a different way of doing things.

We believe in the power of the South African people. Many people would want to lend a hand and help make our country better if only they knew how. Our goal is to empower those people.

# Be productive - not destructive

There have been protests about service delivery and corruption in the past. But they haven't worked for many reasons. Many people who are outraged by corruption see those protests as destructive and dangerous rather than useful. Many people steer clear for their own physical safety. Many see those protests as yet another reason to fear for the future of this country.

We are not like that.

We are suggesting we stand together in protest, but we want a peaceful, productive and inclusive protest. There are people trying to fix things, we want to make it easier for them, not harder. Destroying things and blaming each other will only make things worse.

# Our focus

There is lot going wrong in South Africa, and a lot that deserves attention. We need to be strategic about where we focus our efforts.

Our initial focus is to overcome the electricity crisis. Once we have made some headway into that issue we will move onto others.

By impacting the electricity crisis aim to:

- Make staying in South Africa less risky for individuals
- Lower the cost of living
- Improve all service delivery, everything relies on electricity
- Stop businesses from closing, empower people to do good work

In order to do that, we need to get good at standing up to corruption and making strategic demands. As our community grows in numbers and experience, we will expand our goals.

We have a lot of work to do.
